420 Bot
=======

Tells the time where it is 4:20pm

Registering
-----------
Until I fix it up you will need to change the username and URL to something
that suits your setup.

Then on the command line

python3 bot.py --register username password

That will then create the creditials. Run bot.py without the register
and you should be right to go.
